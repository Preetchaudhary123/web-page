            <h2>How I Fell in Love with Python</h2>
            <p>I started Python only as a subject for my school, but I didn’t think I would be in love with Python so much. I first started it as only a subject, but then I started to learn it with more attention, and it was able to catch my interest. I started to like it, then I started to practice a little off the book, or rather the syllabus, and I still loved it.</p>
            <p>I think sometimes you have to give some time to things you don’t like, and who knows, you might eventually start to love them.</p>
